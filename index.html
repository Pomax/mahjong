      <h1>This is a programming tutorial.</h1>

      <p>
        This is a fully functional implementation of the game of mahjong,
        with competitive computer players, made for two reasons. The first
        being that I like mahjong and I wanted to be able to play it on
        a computer without having to install any software for that, and
        the second being that it's a great example by which to explain how
        to go about writing software that isn't trivial. We've all seen
        tutorials for writing a "todo app", or "a single web page", but
        those aren't things you'd actually want to write if you were to
        make something: they're simple toy exercises to show off "how
        easily you can make something". The problem is that tutorials
        like this gloss over the fact that actually making something rather
        than doing a simple exercise isn't easy. Writing software is hard.
      </p>

      <p>
        And because it's hard, being told that it's easy also makes it
        really easy to forget to plan for hardship: once you find something
        you <em>actually</em> want to do, you soon discover that just
        following the same methodology of that easy, toy implementation
        makes you run into all kinds of obstacles, and if you're not
        careful, or you don't have someone to help you get on track,
        that thing you wanted to make just grinds to a halt before it
        gets abandoned altogether. Tutorials don't teach you how to
        plan for work you know is going to take more than a few days
        to get done, so what if there was a  tutorial that did? A
        tutorial that covered the space <em>between</em> toy problems
        and product programming as a day job? That's where this comes in.
      </p>

      <p style="display: none">
        And not just because of the amount of code involved, it's also
        because you need to understand how much you can break up the work,
        when to recognise you're going too many different things, and
        when to abandon something that just doens't seem to want to work
        so that you can try a different approach. Programming is hard,
        you're going to fail at <em>some</em> point, and it would be super
        nice if there was a tutorial that didn't just tell you want to do,
        but also told you what failure looks like, so you can spot it,
        and maybe even avoid it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game you can play, above, took about two months to write in
        my spare time, and I'm going to assume you'll be doing the same,
        because you probably already have a job, or you're attending school,
        and you don't have the luxury of spending 16 hours a day on personal
        projects. So: if you want to learn to program something non-trivial,
        and you understand that this means you'll probably be working on it
        for a couple of weeks, or even a month or two: this might just be
        the tutorial for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, if you just came here to <em>play</em> mahjong, then
        as an added bonus, you can! Keep reading for an explanation of
        how mahjong works, and specifically which rule set and scoring
        system this particular implementation of mahjong supports.

      <h1>The how of Mahjong</h1>

      <p>
        Mahjong is a four player tile game where players compete to form a
        winning "hand" of 14 tiles, arranged (in general) as four triplets
        (either consecutive tiles within the same suit, or genuine triplets with
        the same tile three times), and a pair (one tile, twice).
      </p>

      <p>
        The traditional game uses 144 tiles, consisting of three numbered suits,
        seven types of "honour" tile, and two sets of bonus tiles. Specifically:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            4x Numerical tiles 1 through 9 with "dots" ornamentation<br />(traditionally
            called 筒, "coin").

    <section id="gameplay">
      <h2>Game play</h2>

      <p>
        Core game play is about as simple as it gets: everyone starts with 13
        tiles, and players take turns in which they draw a tile from the pile of
        undealt tiles, check to see if they can form a winning, 14 tile pattern,
        and if not, discard one of their tiles so they're back at 13, after
        which it is the next player's turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        The "actual game" part, rather than "random chance" aspect comes in the
        form of "claims", where players may claim a tile as it is being
        discarded if they can use that tile to form certain sets. In this case,
        it immediately becomes their turn, irrespective of whose turn it
        "should" have been, and rather than drawing a tile from the undealt
        tiles, they take the discarded tile as their 14<sup>th</sup> tile.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="rules">
      <h2>Rules around claiming discards</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          if a player has two identical tiles in their hand, they may claim a
          third tile when another player discards it.
        </li>
        <li>
          if a player has three identical tiles in their hand, they may claim
          the fourth tile when another player discards it.
        </li>
        <li>
          if a player is waiting for a specific tile to win, they may claim that
          winning tile when another player discards it regardless of what the
          tile is needed for and whether that would be a legal claim if the
          player were not winning on it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If none of the above claims are made, then the player whose turn it is
        next is allowed to pick up the discard tile rather than drawing a tile
        from the undealt tiles, in order to form a set consisting of three
        consecutive numbers within the same suit. Note that these sets are
        typically worth no points, and will typically even negatively impact the
        hand score by ruling out scores based on true-set hand patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the case when a tile has claims by multiple players, a winning claims
        trump any other claims, and a real claim trumps a player wishing to form
        a set of consecutive tiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        When honouring a claim, the receiving player <strong>must</strong>
        reveal all tiles in the set they formed, and put those tiles aside,
        face-up. These tiles are considered "locked", and can no longer be used
        for anything, with a single exception:
      </p>

      <p>
        If a player has a locked, true set of three tiles already on the table,
        and they draw (not claim) the fourth tile, they are allowed to add that
        tile to their locked set of three, forming a locked set of four. If a
        player elects to do this, they receive a new tile from the undealt set
        of tiles to compensate for the "loss" of a tile. If a player forgets to
        do this, they they will not have enough tiles left to form a winning
        hand, and may even be penalized for playing a hand with the wrong number
        of tiles.
      </p>

      <h2>Rule clarifications</h2>

      <p>
        A player is <em>not required</em> to declare sets if they do not need to
        claim a tile for them. If a player has a set of three or four tiles in
        their hand, due to having started the game with them, or having drawn
        tiles over a number of turns to end up with them in hand, they are under
        no obligation to reveal that fact. Winning with unrevealed tiles
        typically incurs a bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that there are special considerations when a player has four of the
        same tile in their hand. They may declare this and lock the four tiles
        as a set that is no longer in their hand, receiving an extra tile to
        prevent them from having too few tiles to form a winning hand (revealing
        the tiles depending on the exact rules being played. Some rules do not
        require this kind of set to be revealed, meaning other players will not
        know which tile has become unavailable, and so may try to win on a tile
        that cannot ever appear during that round of play). They may also elect
        to keep all four tiles in their hand so that three of the tiles can be
        used as one set, and the fourth tile can be used to form a numerical
        set. Note that because a winning hand has to consist of four sets and a
        pair, a player who wishes to count all four tiles as a single set will
        <em>have</em> to declare that set, or they will not have enough tiles
        with which to form the necessary number of sets and pair.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="scoring">
      <h2>Scoring</h2>

      <p>
        Scoring of hands is entirely dependent on the style of mahjong played,
        but can be split into two ways to count points:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>points and doublings</em>, in which players gain points for
          individual sets, and score doublings for particular combinations of
          sets. Typically this scoring system has an "upper limit", limiting how
          many points players can score per hand.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>faan</em>, in which player's hands are assigned a "hand score"
          based on specific sets and patterns of sets, and this hand score is
          then translated into a player score based on a rule-dependent mapping.
          Typically this scoring system has both an upper limit, to fix how many
          points players can score per hand, as well as a "lower limit", in
          which getting a higher hand score does not alter the resulting player
          score for several steps. E.g. a hand worth 5 or 6 faan may both score
          as 5 faan, with a hand worth 7 faan assigned a higher score.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additionally, rules typically use one of two "score settling" methods:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Winner takes all, in which the winner is paid their player score by
          the other players. In this system, winning is more important than
          forming high scoring hand patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone pays everyone, in which the winning player is paid their
          score by the other players, and the other players all pay each other
          based on the difference in scoring. In this system, forming high
          scoring hand patterns is more important than just winning.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="this-game">
      <h1>About this particular implementation</h1>

      <p>
        The game on this page can be played using two different rulesets:
        Chinese Classical rules, and Cantonese rules.
      </p>

      <h2>Chinese Classical (default)</h2>

      <ul>

        The conversion table for turning faan into a hand score is:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr><th>faan</th><th>hand score</th></tr>
        <tr><td>0</td><td>0.5</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>8</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5-6 (laak 1)</td><td>16</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7+ (laak 2)</td><td>32</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Because of the payment rules explained above, a hand score leads to
        a total winnings of either 4x the points when winning off of a discard
        (discarding player pays double, the other two players pay the base
        score), or 6x the points when declaring a self-drawn win (all other
        players pay double).

          that it recommends you claim will be highlighted in pink when someone else plays it.</li>
        <li>When playing with bot recommendations turned on, recommended discards will be highlighted
          with a single black bar at the top of the tile.</li>
        <li>Regardless of suggestion settings, the tile you drew during your turn will be highlighted
          using a green bar at the bottom of the tile, and your currently selected tile will have a
          full green border.</li>
